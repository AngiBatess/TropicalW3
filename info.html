<h1>Plan.Plan.Plan.</h1>
<p> You can't just pack your bags and head off to the nearest tropical island. Unless your rich but I'm talking about the average joe. So what is the best way to make your dreams come true? I have a few tips that will help with your budgeting! </p>
<ol>
<li><em>Save some money</em>
  If you can spare $50 a month, over time you will have enough to travel. Keep in mind expenses such as a plane ticket, hotel, food and transportation. If you search the internet you can definetley find deals that have all-inclusive stays.       </li>
<li><em>Plan early</em>
  The earlier you start. The better. Have an idea of where your dream vacation is and start saving NOW. $50 dollars a month over a year is $600 dollars closer towards your island dream.       </li>
<li><em>Think ahead</em>
  Factor in other costs such as souveniours, fancy restraunts, drinks or just some extra money to have incase you need it.       </li>
